Specification for Google Drive API Toolkit

1. Program Description

The Google Drive API Toolkit is a comprehensive toolkit designed to interact with the Google Drive API. The toolkit will be able to authenticate with Google Drive, perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on files and folders, and handle errors and exceptions. 

2. Core Classes, Functions, and Methods

The toolkit will consist of the following core classes, functions, and methods:

- `GoogleDriveAPI`: This is the main class that will handle the interaction with the Google Drive API.
  - `__init__(self, credentials)`: Initializes the GoogleDriveAPI class with the provided credentials.
  - `authenticate(self)`: Authenticates with Google Drive using the provided credentials.
  - `create_file(self, file_name, file_content)`: Creates a new file with the given name and content.
  - `read_file(self, file_id)`: Reads the content of a file with the given id.
  - `update_file(self, file_id, new_content)`: Updates the content of a file with the given id.
  - `delete_file(self, file_id)`: Deletes a file with the given id.
  - `create_folder(self, folder_name)`: Creates a new folder with the given name.
  - `delete_folder(self, folder_id)`: Deletes a folder with the given id.
  - `handle_error(self, error)`: Handles any errors that occur during the execution of the above methods.

3. Non-Standard Dependencies

The Google Drive API Toolkit will require the following non-standard dependencies:

- `google-auth`: This library is used for authentication with Google APIs.
- `google-auth-httplib2`: This library is used for making HTTP requests to Google APIs.
- `google-auth-oauthlib`: This library is used for OAuth2 authentication with Google APIs.
- `google-api-python-client`: This library is used for interacting with Google APIs.
- `httplib2`: This library is used for making HTTP requests.
- `oauthlib`: This library is used for OAuth2 authentication.

4. Error Handling

The toolkit will handle errors and exceptions using Python's built-in error handling mechanisms. Any errors that occur during the execution of the toolkit's methods will be caught and handled by the `handle_error` method. This method will log the error and provide a meaningful message to the user. 

5. Security

The toolkit will use secure OAuth2 authentication to authenticate with the Google Drive API. The user's credentials will be securely stored and used only for authentication purposes. All HTTP requests will be made over secure HTTPS connections. 

6. Performance

The toolkit will be designed to perform operations as efficiently as possible. The toolkit will use caching and other optimization techniques to minimize the number of API calls and reduce the amount of data transferred over the network. 

7. Documentation

The toolkit will be fully documented, with clear and concise descriptions of all classes, functions, and methods. The documentation will include examples of how to use the toolkit, as well as troubleshooting tips for common issues.
