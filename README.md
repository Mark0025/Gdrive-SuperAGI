To create a Google Drive API toolkit, we'll use Python and the Google Client Library. The toolkit will consist of several functions that interact with Google Drive, such as uploading a file, downloading a file, listing files, and deleting a file. 

Here are the main classes and functions we'll use:

1. GoogleDriveAPI: This is the main class that will contain all the methods for interacting with Google Drive.
2. upload_file: This method will upload a file to Google Drive.
3. download_file: This method will download a file from Google Drive.
4. list_files: This method will list all files in the Google Drive.
5. delete_file: This method will delete a file from Google Drive.

Now, let's write the code for the toolkit. 

Firstly, we need to install the Google Client Library. We can do this by creating a requirements.txt file.
